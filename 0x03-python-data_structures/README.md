# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## What are lists and how to use them?
- Lists are a fundamental data structure in programming that allow you to store and organize multiple values in a single variable.
In Python, lists are ordered, mutable (can be changed), and can contain elements of different types.
Lists are denoted by square brackets [ ] and the elements are separated by commas.

## What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists?
- Mutable vs. Immutable: Strings are immutable, meaning their individual characters cannot be changed once they are created.
In contrast, lists are mutable, allowing you to modify, add, or remove elements.
- Types of Elements: Strings are made up of individual characters, which are always of type string. 
Lists, on the other hand, can contain elements of different types, such as strings, numbers, booleans, or even other lists.
- Indexing: Strings can be accessed using positive and negative indices to retrieve individual characters, but you cannot modify them directly. Lists,however,can be accessed and modified using indices to retrieve or update specific elements.
