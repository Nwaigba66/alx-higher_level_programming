# Python - if/else, loops, functions:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- Why indentation is so important in Python
- How to use range
# Python is awesome for several reasons:
- Simple and Easy to Learn.
- Large Community and Libraries.
- Versatile.
- Interpreted Language.
- Cross-Platform.
- Overall, Python's simplicity, versatility, and large community make it an awesome language for developers of all skill levels.

# Why indentation is so important in Python?
- In Python, indentation is very important because it is used to define blocks of code. In many other programming languages, such as C++, blocks of code are defined using curly braces.
  However, in Python, indentation is used instead of curly braces.
  
# How to use range?
- The range() function is used to generate a sequence of numbers in Python. It is a built-in function and it is commonly used in loops to iterate a specific number of times. 
- The range() function takes three arguments: start, stop, and step, and returns a range object that represents a sequence of numbers.
# For this tasks we will use the following files and functions:
- 0-positive_or_negative.py:
This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number every time it is executed.
- 1-last_digit.py:
This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number every time it is executed.
- 2-print_alphabet.py:
This program prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
- 3-print_alphabt.py:
This program prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
- 4-print_hexa.py:
This program prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.
- 5-print_comb2.py:
This program prints numbers from 0 to 99.
- 6-print_comb3.py:
THis program prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- 7-islower.py:
This is a function that checks for lowercase character.
- 8-uppercase.py:
This is a fuction that prints a string in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- 9-print_last_digit.py:
This function prints the last digit of a number.
- 10-add.py:
This is a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- 11-main.py:
This function computes a to the power of b, and return the value.
- 12-fizzbuzz.py:
This function prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
- 100-print-tebahpla.py:
This program prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase, not followed by a new line.
- 101-remove_char_at.py:
This function creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n.
- 102-magic_calculation.py:
This file contains a python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as analyzing its Python Bytecode.
